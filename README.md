# Debugging with ipdb

## Learning Goals

- Explain how `ipdb` is a more flexible REPL than the Python shell.
- Install `ipdb` via Pipfile.
- Debug a program using `ipdb.set_trace()` within the body of your file.

## Key Vocab

- **Code Block**: a collection of code that is interpreted together. Python
  groups code blocks by indentation level.
- **Data Type**: a specific kind of data. The Python interpreter uses these
  types to determine which actions can be performed on different data items.
- **Exception**: a type of error that can be predicted and handled without
  causing a program to crash.
- **Function**: a named code block that performs a sequence of actions when it
  is called.
- **Interpreter**: a program that executes other programs. Python programs
  require the Python interpreter to be installed on your computer so that they
  can be run.
- **Python Shell**: an interactive interpreter that can be accessed from the
  command line.
- **REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)**: A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is a special
  tool for programming where you can type in code and see what happens right
  away. It's like having a conversation with the computer. You say something 
  (type in code), the computer understands it and does what you asked, and then
  it shows you the result.
- **Scope**: the area in your program where a specific variable can be called.

## Introduction

We'll cover `ipdb`, a type of REPL, and discuss how to install and use it to
debug a program.

---

## What Is a REPL?

You've already been introduced to REPLs through using the Python Shell. REPL
stands for _Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop_. It is an interactive programming
environment that takes a user's input, evaluates it and returns the result to
the user.

Python installs with its own REPL, which is the Python shell that you've
already been using. Every time you type `python` into your terminal, you're
entering into a REPL.

---

## What Is `ipdb`?

`ipdb` is another Python REPL with some added functionality. It is built on
top of `pdb`, a REPL in Python's standard library, and provides helpful features
such as tab completion, syntax highlighting, and better tracebacks. When you enter
`ipdb`, you are entering a brand new interactive environment. For any code you
want to play with in the Python shell, you have to copy and paste or write your
code in the Python shell itself. `ipdb`, on the other hand, is like a REPL that
you can inject into your program.

`ipdb` is far more flexible than the Python shell. Once you install the `ipdb`
library (via this lesson's `Pipfile`), you can use `ipdb.set_trace()` anywhere
in your code.

`ipdb.set_trace()` gives you similar functionality to using `debugger` in a
JavaScript application, in that it lets you set a **breakpoint** in your code
that will pause the execution of your program at a certain point so you can
inspect the variables, functions, and other context available at a specific
place in your code.

So when you place the line `ipdb.set_trace()` in your code, that line will get
interpreted at runtime (as your program is executed). When the interpreter hits
that line, your program will actually _freeze_ and your terminal will turn into
a REPL that exists right in the middle of your program, wherever you added the
`ipdb.set_trace()` line.

Let's take a look. In this repository, you'll see a file called
`ipdb_is_awesome.py`.

---

## Using `ipdb.set_trace()`

First, let's make sure we have installed the packages from our `Pipfile`,
including `ipdb`.

```console
> pipenv install
> pipenv shell
```

> NOTE: This will only install `ipdb` in your **virtual environment**. If you
> want to install `ipdb` system-wide, you must exit your virtual environment and
> run the following command in your local environment:
>
> ```console
> > pip install ipdb
> ```

Look at the code in `lib/ipdb_is_awesome.py`. You should see the following code:

```py
import ipdb

def tracing_the_function():
    inside_the_function = "We're inside the function"
    print(inside_the_function)
    print("We're about to stop because of ipdb!")
    ipdb.set_trace()
    this_variable_hasnt_been_interpreted_yet = \
        "The program froze before it could read me!"
    print(this_variable_hasnt_been_interpreted_yet)

tracing_the_function()
```

At the top of the file, `import ipdb` is a statement that loads the `ipdb`
library in this file when our application runs, very similar to `import`
statements in JavaScript.

> We will elaborate on Python `import` statements later in Phase 3, but note now
> that Python `import` statements **do not** use quotes or semicolons.

After importing `ipdb`, _which you must do to use `ipdb`_, we define a function,
and then call that function.

In the directory of this repo, in your terminal, run the file by typing
`python lib/ipdb_is_awesome.py`. Now, look at your terminal. You should see
something like this:

```txt
> python lib/ipdb_is_awesome.py
We're inside the function
We're about to stop because of ipdb!
> /lib/ipdb_is_awesome.py(11)tracing_the_function()
     10     this_variable_hasnt_been_interpreted_yet = \
---> 11         "The program froze before it could read me!"
     12     print(this_variable_hasnt_been_interpreted_yet)

ipdb>
```

You have frozen your program _as it executes_ and are now inside a REPL _inside
your program_. You basically just stopped time! How cool is that?

In the terminal, in your `ipdb` console, type the variable name
`inside_the_function` and hit enter. You should see a return value of
`"We're inside the function"`.

```txt
ipdb> inside_the_function
"We're inside the function!"
```

You are able to explore the data _inside_ the function in which you've placed
your binding. Any variables or functions that are available from the line you
placed your `ipdb.set_trace()` will be available to you to explore from the
terminal.

> NOTE: Any names that have been assigned to variables (or functions, methods
> classes, etc.) can be auto-completed by hitting `tab`. If your name doesn't
> autocomplete, it hasn't been defined yet!

Now, in the terminal, in your `ipdb` console, type the variable name
`this_variable_hasnt_been_interpreted_yet`. You should see a `NameError`. That's
because the binding you placed on line 7 actually froze the program on line 7
and the variable you just called hasn't been interpreted yet. Consequently, our
REPL doesn't know about it.

Now, in the terminal, type `c` (for **continue**), and you'll leave your `ipdb`
console and the program will continue to execute.

## Using `ipdb` to Debug

In addition to _exploring_ code inside `ipdb`, you can also manipulate variables
and try code out. This is where `ipdb` really becomes helpful for debugging. If
you have a function that isn't doing what it's supposed to do, instead of making
changes in your text editor and running the tests over and over until you get it
working, you can put a binding in your code and try things out. Once you've
figured out how to fix the problem, you then update the code in your text editor
accordingly.

Let's walk through an example together. In this repository, you'll see a
`testing` folder containing a file `ipdb_debugging_test.py`. This is a test
for the file `lib/ipdb_debugging.py`.

In `ipdb_debugging.py`, we have a broken function. Run `pytest` to see the
failing test. You should see the following:

```txt
=== FAILURES ===
___ TestIpdbDebugging.test_adds_two ___

self = <testing.ipdb_debugging_test.TestIpdbDebugging object at 0x105862fa0>

    def test_adds_two(self):
        '''adds_two() adds 2 to input arg and returns sum'''
>       assert(plus_two(3) == 5)
E       assert 3 == 5
E        +  where 3 = plus_two(3)

testing/ipdb_debugging_test.py:10: AssertionError
=== short test summary info ===
FAILED ipdb_debugging.py adds_two() adds 2 to input arg and returns sum - assert 3 == 5
=== 1 failed in 0.04s ===
```

So what's happening? In our `FAILURES` section, we can see that the test is
calling the `plus_two` function and passing in `3` as an argument. Below that we
can see that the test is expecting `5` to be returned, but that `3` is being
returned instead. Let's take another look at the code in `ipdb_debugging.py`:

```py
def plus_two(num):
    num + 2
    return num
```

So while our function is adding 2 to `num` in the first line of our function, it
appears that it is not _updating_ `num`. We have imported `ipdb` at the top of
our `testing/ipdb_debugging_test.py` file so we can use it to verify this. Let's
place an `ipdb.set_trace()` in our code, right after that line:

```py
def plus_two(num):
    num + 2
    ipdb.set_trace()
    return num
```

Now, run
[`pytest -s`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/capture-stdout-stderr.html#setting-capturing-methods-or-disabling-capturing)
(the `-s` allows us to see and interact with our code's output during testing)
and drop into your `ipdb` console. Your terminal should look like this:

```txt
ipdb_debugging.py adds_two() adds 2 to input arg and returns sum > /lib/ipdb_debugging.py(8)plus_two()
      6     num + 2
      7     ipdb.set_trace()
----> 8     return num

ipdb>
```

Let's check our current return value by typing `num` at the `ipdb` prompt. You
should see something like this:

```txt
ipdb> num
3
ipdb>
```

By checking the value of the variable inside our ipdb console, we can confirm
that `num` is still equal to `3` and, as a result, the function is returning
`3`.

How can we modify the code so that the function behaves in the expected way? We
need to _update_ the value of our `num` variable so that it's equal to the sum
of itself and 2. Play around inside your `ipdb` console: try code that you think
will update `num` as needed, then check the value of `num` to see if it worked.
Once you figure it out you can type `exit` in your terminal to get out of
`ipdb`, update the code in your text editor, and rerun the test to verify it's
passing. Be sure to remove the `ipdb.set_trace()`!

It can take a little while to get the hang of using `ipdb`, so don't worry if
it's still a little confusing. As you start working with more complex functions
and data structures, you'll find it can be a very helpful tool.
